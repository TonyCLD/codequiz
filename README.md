I made an effort to document this project starting with making notes in the code and have lots of updates to git hub. The project does have a timer, it does load questions (three of them). You can click to get to the three questions. I still need to build in some evaluation if statements and then capture date from the scores and then display them on the page. Also use remote storage to to display all time high scores.
